This is a WIP, you can follow the [Cantor's build guide](https://github.com/diepala/cantor/blob/main/doc/build_guide.md), as it is quite similar!

## Parts
As for the parts list, you will need:
- 2x PCB (The left and right half are the same)
- 44 Chocv1 Keys
- 44 Chocv1 Keycaps
- 44 Hotswap sockets for Chocv1 (optional)
- 2x TRRS jacks (PJ-320A)
- 2x Blackpill microcontrollers (STM32F401CC)

## Gerbers
You can find the Gerber files needed to order the PCB on the `Gerbers` directory. Look for the .zip of whatever version you would like!

## Firmware
Firmware for this keyboard in not in the QMK tree yet. You can find sources in this [branch](https://github.com/azhizhinov/qmk_firmware/tree/elcantorhs-qmk/keyboards/elcantorhs). At this moment you have to compile the firmware yourself.
